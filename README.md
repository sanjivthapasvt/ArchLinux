Quick Arch Linux Configuration with hyprland from fresh install if I don't have time

In this I have used ML4W hyprland dotfiles to quick install along side applications I required I will be adding more to this if I have time I would dedicate to this if I have time till then

I created this script just for my personal use if you want to use it you can also use it

I have also included my own config files in this that is customized to my own liking you can clone this repositry and put the files in ~/.config to use my setup

To Get Started:
```bash
sudo pacman -S git <br>
git clone <br> https://github.com/sanjivthapasvt/ArchLinux.git <br>
cd ArchLinux <br>
chmod +x install.sh <br>
./install.sh <br>
'''bash
Thank you have fun!!
